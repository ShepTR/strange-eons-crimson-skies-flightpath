# This file allows you add multiple copies of a component to a deck without
# creating extra copies of the file. When using a command like Make Deck or
# Virtual Deck, this list will be consulted for each .eon file in the task
# folder. If the list has an entry for the .eon file, then the listed number of
# copies will be used. Otherwise, one copy is used.
#
# To add an entry for an .eon file, add a line that consists of the file name
# (the .eon extension is optional), an equals sign, and the number of copies:
#
# AnnotatedManual.eon = 4
#
# Tip:  You can add copies to this file by dragging the desired .eon
#       component file from the project pane and dropping it in the text editor.
#
# Note: When entering a file name, the following characters must be "escaped"
#       by inserting a \ in front of them: :, =, #, !, \, and spaces.
